# WearWeather

This is an Android app that shows current weather and predicts climatic conditions for a particular pin code or area which could be changed in the settings. The weather data is provided by Openweathermap API. It includes a detailed view of Windspeed, direction , Pressure and humidity. This includes a watch face that is automatically installed in the android wear when the user installs Sunshine App on the phone.

##What is it?

This is an Android wear watch face for an existing Android weather app.

##Why this Project?

Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into usersâ€™ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.

## Open Weather Map API Key is required.

In order for the Sunshine app to function properly an API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build.
We recommend that each student obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://openweathermap.org/appid#use), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties
`MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
