As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.\r\n\r\n##Platform and Libraries Used\r\n\r\n- Build Tools version 23.0.3\r\n- Android Support AppCompat 23.2.1\r\n- Android Support Annotations 23.2.1\r\n- Android Support GridLayout 23.2.1\r\n- Android Support CardView 23.2.1\r\n- Android Support Design 23.2.1\r\n- Android Support RecyclerView 23.2.1\r\n- Google Play Services GCM 8.4.0\r\n- Google Play Services Wearable 8.4.0\r\n- BumpTech Glide 3.5.2\r\n\r\n## Open Weather Map API Key is required.\r\n\r\nIn order for the Sunshine app to function properly an API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build. <br>\r\nInclude the API key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties\r\n`MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey=\"<UNIQUE_API_KEY\">` <br>\r\n\r\n## Android Version Targeting\r\n\r\nDevices Running Kitkat (API 19) or above are supported\r\n\r\n##Attribution\r\n\r\nThe weather data is provided by the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api) <br>\r\nThe weather app code was provided by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/\r\nAdvanced_Android_Development/tree/7.05_Pretty_Wallpaper_Time).  \r\n",
